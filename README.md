## 1. Project Summary
We propose creating a dashboard website that explores environmental data associated with drainage basins of the Mississippi River in central USA. We would like to create a large interactive map that lets the user see the full extent of the Mississippi River drainage system and zoom into specific sub-basins[^1] to look at data per basin, using data from HydroSHEDS[^2]. We would like the user to be able to select datasets to show on a choropleth map of the sub-basins with an adjacent chart or set of charts that summarize the data. We would like to include the option to include a bivariate analysis.

[^1]: Basins and sub-basins per the U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Unit System, HUC.
[^2]: HydroSHEDS v1 geodatabase project: [hydrosheds.org/about](https://www.hydrosheds.org/about)

## 3. Requirements Document

i. Representation:
<br>
Each basemap tileset or context overlay:

| Title of layer (abbreviated) | Description of source | Description of symbolization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basemap of USA | Natural Earth | Neutral base layer |
| Watersheds of the Mississippi River | HydroSHEDS | Distinct borders, fill color based on data |

ii. Interaction
<br>
Each unique interface widget:

| Title of function (abbreviated) | Coding by operator and operand | Description of behavior and UI design |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Map scaled to Miss. watershed extent | Zoom, Pan | Allows user to explore the extent |
| Datasets per sub-basin | Overlay | User selects which data to display via choropleth on map |
