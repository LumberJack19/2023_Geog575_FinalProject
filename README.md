## 1. Project Summary
We propose creating a dashboard website that explores environmental data associated with drainage basins of the Mississippi River in central USA. We would like to create a large interactive map that lets the user see the full extent of the Mississippi River drainage system and zoom into specific sub-basins[^1] to look at data per basin, using data from HydroSHEDS[^2]. We would like the user to be able to select datasets to show on a choropleth map of the sub-basins with an adjacent chart or set of charts that summarize the data. We would like to include the option to include a bivariate analysis.
